# 05-Task-manager-Node.js

This is project 5/50 of my Node.js projects series. 

It's a task manager API. It handles CRUD operation so that:

GET requests to /tasks/ returns all tasks in DB. 

POST requests to /tasks/ create new tasks. 

GET requests to /tasks/:id returns the task with that id. 

PATCH requests to /tasks/:id updates the task with id. 

DELETE requests to /tasks/:id delete the task with that id from DB. 

The project has all Error handled.

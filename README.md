# 05-Task-manager-Node.js

This is project 5/50 of my Node.js projects series. It's a task manager API. It handles CRUD operation so that GET requests to /tasks/ returns all tasks in DB, POST requests to /tasks/ create new tasks, GET requests to /tasks/:id returns the task with that id, PATCH requests to /tasks/:id updates the task with id and DELETE requests to /tasks/:id delete the task with that id from DB. The project has all Error handled.
